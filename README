Thundercloud was a distributed stress-testing and reporting tool I wrote.

Its goal was to stress test cloud servers with real-world traffic of varying latency, bandwidth, etc.  It plotted a requests/sec served graph after each test run.

It's written in Python with Twisted.  It could use some improvement (daemonization, better user segmentation, etc) but worked overall.
